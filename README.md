MATLAB codes Structure-preserving model reduction approach for structured index-2 descriptor-systems. 
The directory contains MATLAB codes for two model problems; one has the dimension N=20, and the other has the dimension N=12000. 
The readme file readme_N_20.txt gives the details of the MOR execution order for model problem 1 (N=20). 
The readme file readme_N_12000.txt gives the details of the MOR execution order for model problem 2 (N=12000). 
Also, the log files for the model order reduction generation are provided.

Thank you
